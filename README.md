This end-to-end cost analysis project simulates a government contract pricing response for a Time & Materials (T&M) contract focused on cloud engineering, DevSecOps, Agile delivery, and security automation. 
Built entirely from a mock Request for Proposal (RFP), this project demonstrates my ability to analyze technical requirements, estimate labor and ODCs, apply indirects and fee structures, and produce an audit-aligned bid package in accordance with federal pricing standards.

Key Deliverables:

   - RFP Document outlining CLINs, labor roles, periods of performance, and contract structure

   - Powerpoint Slidedeck summarizing different sections of the Pricing Model Workbook

   - RPP Matrix Document detailing compliance and directs RFP sections to appropriate document or tab in the Pricing Model Workbook

   - Basis of Estimate (BOE) with quantitative labor hour justification and cost assumptions

   - Pricing Volume Narrative detailing methodology, indirect rates, ODC handling, fee policy, and compliance notes

   - Excel Pricing Model including burdened labor pricing, ODCs, CLIN breakout, scenario support, and dashboard

   - Project Overview Document summarizing the contract environment, pricing strategy, and key assumptions

Key Features:

   - Breakdowns of hours, labor cost estimations between base year and option year
    
   - Transparent labor hour justification mapped to CLINs and functional roles

   - Complete burdening of fringe, overhead, G&A, and fee in line with T&M pricing practices

   - ODC treatment with applied fee and traceability across tabs and documents

   - Visual pricing dashboard with pie and bar charts, contract totals, and role-level breakdowns

   - DCAA/DCMA-audit-ready workbook structure and note boxes for compliance traceability
